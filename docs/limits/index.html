<p><em>This means you will have to resubscribe to all the rule groups for the list you want.</em></p>
<p>Apologies that this broke your rule group subscription, but I figured I would rather make a breaking change so that you can see what has happened, than leave you subscribed to just the first 200k entries of a list while the list itself continues to grow.</p>
